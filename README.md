# Model-Predictive-Control-of-Fuel-Cell-Oxygen-Excess-Ratio
Updates and results of the main project as part of the Automotive Control Systems course

## My Contribution:
1. Developed the control logic for a tracking model predictive controller that incorporated a predictive lookahead for the current demand by the user, based on the chosen drive cycle, on MATLAB.
2. Worked on the fuel cell plant model, implemented on Simulink, and used a novel method to linearize the plant model.
